The data/ folder contains all the essential datasets used in the project. These datasets are the building blocks for training and evaluating the stock price prediction models. Here's a breakdown of the files:

stock_data_raw.csv: Contains the raw data scraped from Reddit discussions. It includes the post title, text, subreddit information, sentiment score, and other related details for various stocks.

stock_cleaned.csv: A cleaned version of the raw data where unnecessary information has been removed, and the text data has been preprocessed (e.g., special characters, stopwords, and duplicates removed).

stock_preprocessed.csv: Further cleaned and tokenized Reddit posts with sentiment labels (Positive, Neutral, Negative) ready for sentiment analysis.

all_companies_classification_data.csv: Contains the historical stock price data for companies like Tesla, Apple, and Amazon. The data is annotated with target labels based on price changes: Increase (+1), Decrease (-1), or No Change (0).

merged_stock_sentiment_data.csv: The final dataset combining sentiment analysis results with stock price data, aligned by date and company. This dataset is used for model training and prediction.

These files allow you to dive deep into the stock price prediction process, from collecting and cleaning data to building and testing predictive models.
